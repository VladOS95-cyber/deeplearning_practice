## Artificial Neural Networks

## Description
Designed, developed and trained differen supervised and unsupervised Deep Learning models.

## Models

- ANN_Churn_Modelling: Artificial Neural Network model to apply bank's client data and predict if client exits bank or not.
- convolutional_neural_network: Convolutional Neural Network model to apply pictures of cats and dogs and determine if new picture is cat or dog.
- RNN_GoogleStockPrice: Recurrent Neural Network model to apply historical Google's stock data to predict new open price of the financial market day.
- SOP_Fraud_Probabilities: Self Organizing Map + Artificial Neural Network models to apply bank's customers credit data to detect probabilities of fraud clients.
- Boltzmann_Machine_MovieRecommendationSystem: Recommendation system built on Boltzmann_Machine model to predict if user likes a movie or not.
- AutoEncoders_RecommendationSystem: Recommendation system built on Auto_Encoders model to predict how user rates a movie.
